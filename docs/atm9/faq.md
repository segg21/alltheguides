**All The Mods 9** Frequently Asked Questions

??? Question "Why is flight disabled?"
    Flight is disabled in certain dimensions (The Other, Blue Skies, and Twilight Forest), to add more difficulty towards progression. If you dislike this change, it can be [disabled](../help/configs.md#no-fly-zone).

??? Question "Why isn't '`insert name`' mod in ATM9 yet?"
    ATM packs does not literally contain "All The Mods". Our main focus is having mods that's not: 1). buggy, 2). ruins performance, or progression. If a mod supports Minecraft version **1.20.1**, and **Forge** (Not NeoForge), you may make a [suggestion](https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-9/issues/1).
